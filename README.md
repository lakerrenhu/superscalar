# superscalar
#In this project, you will construct a simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor based on Tomasuloâ€™s algorithm that fetches, dispatches, and issues N instructions per #cycle. Only the dynamic scheduling mechanism will be modeled in detail, i.e., perfect caches and perfect branch prediction are assumed.
